    <p>We sell Salmon Cookies, the best in the world! "A cookie is a baked or cooked food that is typically small, 
        flat and sweet. It usually contains flour, sugar and some type of oil or fat. It may include other ingredients 
        such as raisins, oats, chocolate chips, nuts, etc. In most English-speaking countries except for the United States 
        and Canada, crisp cookies are called biscuits. Chewier biscuits are sometimes called cookies even in the United 
        Kingdom.[3] Some cookies may also be named by their shape, such as date squares or bars." -Wiki</p>

        Salmon cookies might seem a little fishy, but that's probably because they are. Nevertheless, do try them, 
        since they sell like hot cakes.
