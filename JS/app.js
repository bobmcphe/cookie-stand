// Within your javascript file (example: app.js), create separate JS object literals for each 
// shop location that outputs the following to the sales.html file:

// 1. Stores the min/max hourly customers, and the average cookies per customer, in object properties
// 2. Uses a method of that object to generate a random number of customers per hour. 
// Objects/Math/random
// 3. Calculate and store the simulated amounts of cookies purchased for each hour at each location using 
// average cookies purchased and the random number of customers generated
// 4. Store the results for each location in a separate arrayâ€¦ perhaps as a property of the object 
// representing that location
// 5. Display the values of each array as unordered lists in the browser
// 6. Calculating the sum of these hourly totals;
